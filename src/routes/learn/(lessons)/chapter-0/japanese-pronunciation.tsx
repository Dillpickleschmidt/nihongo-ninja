              some surprising news that might make your day: Japanese
              pronunciation is probably one of the easiest parts of learning the
              language. No, seriously!

            If you speak English, you can already make almost every sound in
            Japanese. Even better - unlike English's chaotic spelling system
            (quick quiz: how do you pronounce "read" vs "read"? Or try "though,
            through, rough, cough"!), Japanese is almost perfectly consistent.
            Once you learn how to pronounce something, that's it. It works the
            same way every single time.

          <p>
            <span class="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> Now here's where it gets
            fun. Japanese combines these vowels with consonants to make
            syllables. It's like playing with LEGO - just snap a consonant onto
            a vowel!

            POWERFUL THIS KNOWLEDGE IS? <em>*straightens robes*</em> I mean...
            here's the beautiful part: Japanese has only about 71 basic sounds,
            crafting around 100 combinations, while English juggles with around
            250 unique sounds and{" "}
            <span class="font-semibold italic">thousands</span> of chaotic
            letter combinations. Your tongue is already a polyglot prodigy!

          <p>
            <span class="font-extrabold">Student:</span> That's actually really
            encouraging! Though I'm slightly concerned about your mental
            state... What should I practice first?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> Ready to try? Combine
            these consonants with our five vowels: t, n, h, m, and r (and don't

            with practice)

            Try saying „Åì„Çå (ko-re). There you go - you just said "this" in

            speakers attempting Japanese in movies.
