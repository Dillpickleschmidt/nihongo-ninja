          <p>
            <span class="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> These characters are
            inherited from the neighbors in China. For example, the word kanji

            means:

              Romaji is the use of Latin alphabet letters to represent Japanese
              sounds. It serves as a bridge for those who are just beginning
              their journey in the Japanese language. For example, the word
              "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ" can be written as "konnichiwa" in Romaji.

            <span class="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> Romaji is primarily used
            for the benefit of learners and in contexts where Japanese
            characters might not be practical, such as on international signage
            or in technology settings. However, true mastery of Japanese
            involves moving beyond Romaji and immersing oneself in Hiragana,
            Katakana, and Kanji.

          <p>
            <span class="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> Precisely, eager
            student. Romaji can help you get started, but to truly embrace the
            beauty and depth of the Japanese language, you must delve into its
            unique scripts. That is why we will only use Romaji during this
            first chapter.
