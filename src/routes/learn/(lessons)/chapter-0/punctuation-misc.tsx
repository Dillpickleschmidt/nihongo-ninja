            Sensei, I've been learning about Hiragana, but I have some questions
            about other parts of Japanese writing. What can you tell me about
            uppercase and lowercase letters in Japanese?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="ml-24 rounded-2xl border-2 border-dashed border-muted bg-card p-4 shadow-md">

          <p>
            Ah, inquisitive mind, Japanese is a language of simplicity in some
            aspects. Unlike English, Japanese does not distinguish between
            uppercase and lowercase letters. Each character stands proudly on
            its own, without needing to change form.
          </p>

        <div class="mr-[5.75rem] mt-9 rounded-2xl border-2 border-dashed border-muted bg-card p-4 shadow-md">
          <PortraitIcon src="/img/student.png" />
          <p>What about punctuation, like question marks and periods?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ml-24 rounded-2xl border-2 border-dashed border-muted bg-card p-4 shadow-md">
          <PortraitIcon src="/img/guru.png" class="float-end" />
          <p>
            Ah, punctuation—the tiny marks that guide our understanding. In
            Japanese, we do use question marks and periods, but their usage can
            be a bit different. The Japanese question mark (？) is used
            sparingly, often in informal writing or to add emphasis. In more
            formal contexts, the question is usually indicated by the context
            and the sentence-ending particle{" "}
            <span class="font-japanese text-xl">か</span> (ka).
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium">
          Japanese speakers use <span class="font-japanese">か</span> to
          indicate questions in polite and formal contexts. In casual settings,
          they might drop <span class="font-japanese">か</span> and use a rising
          intonation at the end of their sentence, which is written with a
          question mark (？).

          <span class="font-extrabold">Student:</span> Oh, that's weird. I'll
          have to get used to that.

          <PortraitIcon src="/img/student.png" />
          <p>So, what about periods? Surely, they use those... right Sensei?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ml-24 rounded-2xl border-2 border-dashed border-muted bg-card p-4 shadow-md">

          <p>
            Indeed, young grasshopper. The humble period (。) in Japanese is
            called “句点” (kuten). It's used at the end of a sentence, just like
            in English. But instead of a solid dot, it's a hollow circle—imagine
            it as a tiny halo, giving your sentence a celestial send-off.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="mb-4 mt-12 text-center text-3xl font-bold">No Spaces!</h2>
        <div class="mr-[5.75rem] mt-9 rounded-2xl border-2 border-dashed border-muted bg-card p-4 shadow-md">
          <PortraitIcon src="/img/student.png" />
          <p>
            Do Japanese sentences have spaces between words like in English?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="ml-24 rounded-2xl border-2 border-dashed border-muted bg-card p-4 shadow-md">

          <p>
            Ah, spaces, or rather the absence of them, is a unique feature of
            Japanese. In traditional Japanese writing, spaces are not used
            between words. The text flows continuously, like a river. However,
            modern Japanese sometimes uses spaces in children's books or
            language learning materials to help with readability.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium">
          Japanese doesn't use spaces between words. However, when typing,
          you'll notice that characters like 。 and 、 have built-in spaces to
          separate sentences. Additionally, Japanese characters are
          double-width, which means punctuation marks like ? and ! take up more
          space, appearing as ？ and ！.

          <span class="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> It can be at first, but
          with practice, your mind will begin to recognize the patterns and
          break down sentences naturally. It's like learning to read music—once
          you understand the rhythm, you'll be able to play any tune.
